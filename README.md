# Mixxx Merge

A command line tool that makes merging [Mixxx 2.4](https://mixxx.org/) libraries easy.

## Warning

**_This tool is experimental and comes with no warranties. It may corrupt your Mixxx settings, causing you to lose your hot cues, analyzed tracks, and more. I am not responsible for your many hours of lost work if this happens._**

To protect against this, please make a backup of your entire [Mixxx settings directory](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.4/en/chapters/appendix/settings_directory) before using.

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mixxx`
- macOS: `~/Library/Containers/org.mixxx.mixxx/Data/Library/Application  Support/Mixxx`
- Linux: `~/.mixxx/`

## Using

You may download and run a standalone executable from our [releases page](https://github.com/mass8326/mixxx-merge/releases). Use the appropriate file for your operating system.

Alternatively, you can run directly from source code if you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed. Download or clone the repository and use `bun start` in your terminal.
